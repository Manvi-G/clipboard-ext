# PART 1: WEBSITE DESCRIPTION
This is a Chrome browser extension called Clipboard.
When I am working, I often copy one text and then copy another and realize that I have lost the first copy. Such an event inspires this solution. This extension helps people keep track of their copied text. It can be used by anyone who wants to remember multiple texts that they copy, unlike the latest one remembered by our browser currently. The extension will keep adding the copied text by the user in a table that the user can refer to whenever they want and use the data in the table in the manner they want.

The extension displays the copied text in a tabular format with the latest copied note on the top. At the top, the user can see a Search bar to search for a particular text they might have copied some time back. This feature allows for easy retrieval. The user could copy the previous texts, clear them from the queue, or mark them as favorites. Whenever they delete a note, they get an option to undo their action within seconds. They can also select multiple texts, merge them, copy them all, or delete them.

The header has an animation to keep the website fun and exciting. Whenever the user marks a text as a favorite, there is a party animation to make the extension more engaging.

There are also help texts that help users understand the extension's flow and provide guidance if needed. Similarly, there are confirmation messages whenever the user copies or deletes a text.

The website is also 100% accessible by keyboard. A keyboard-only user can navigate through the extension easily, access all the features, and see the helpful tips on hover for mouse users.
